# 🎮 Co‑Op Social Media Platform  
### A Full‑Stack Gaming Community Hub

This project is one of the builds I’m most excited to share — a full‑stack social platform designed specifically for gamers. It blends elements of Facebook, Twitch, and Discord into a single ecosystem where players can connect, form groups, share content, and eventually stream gameplay.

As a physicist, engineer, and developer, I wanted to challenge myself with a system that touches every layer of modern web development: authentication, UI/UX, real‑time features, database design, and scalable architecture. This repository represents that ongoing journey.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Co‑Op Social Media Platform** is an in‑development web application built to help gamers:

- (future) find new friends with similar gaming interests  
- (future) build or expand gaming groups  
- (future) share posts, clips, and updates  
- (future) interact through comments and messaging  
- (future) live‑stream gameplay directly on the platform  

The goal is to create a community‑driven space where players can connect more intentionally than on traditional platforms.

## 🎯 Why I’m Building This

Coming from a background in physics, research, and engineering, I enjoy designing systems that combine structure, logic, and creativity. This project lets me:

- apply full‑stack development skills  
- design relational data models  
- build interactive UI components  
- explore real‑time communication and streaming  
- create something meaningful for a community I care about  

It’s a long‑term build that grows as I grow.
